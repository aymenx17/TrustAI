## Intro


Communities are important for the welfare of societies. Overall in the past wasn't that easy to form or be part of a community and certainly there wasn't enough incentive to do so. Now this is changing. With the technologies brought by Crypto and AI we may be able to do this. With AI will bring people closer and with Crypto we hold the trust in-between. 


There may have been a moment in history we would have been surprised to know about the existence of marketplaces of intellectual values such as books, songs or photos, yet slowly over time this became possible. Now we want to expand the market of intellectual values to its limits. We think thoughts and conversations can be be part of it. Though ultimately there is market for everything if we put in touch the right people together, that's where AI will play a big role in our platform.    


## The platform - How to Start


The idea is a platform providing services for the metaverse. It offers authentic user identity and a comprehensive profile modeled by interacting with the AI and other entities of the metaverse. The AI itself is an offered service assisting the users in their own content creation, making customised NFTs and facilitating the right connections by bringing together individuals or groups that align well with each other's preferences and profiles. The platform uses Zero-Knowldge technology and smart contracts to secure privacy and ownership of the various entities. The platform will enable the creation of countless number of diverse apps, and at some point customised applications are created on the fly by the AI.    

Initially a first app would have a chatgpt-like interface displaying past conversations either with the AI or with another user. Users would connect to the platform through a crypto wallet. And every in-chat interaction at the click may be turned into an NFT with possible royalities. The conversations are private and securely stored in the blockchain.
