## Intro


Communities are important for the welfare of societies. Overall in the past wasn't that easy to form or be part of a community and certainly there wasn't enough incentive to do so. Now this is changing. With the technologies brought by Crypto and AI we may be able to do this. 


There may have been a moment in history where we would have been surprised to know about the existence of marketplaces of intellectual values such as books, songs or photos, yet slowly over time this became possible. Now we want to further expand the market of intellectual values. We believe even thoughts and conversations can be be part of it. Ultimately there is market for everything if we put in touch the right people together, that's where AI will play a big role in our platform.    



## The platform - How to Start

The idea is a platform providing services for the metaverse. It offers authentic user identity and a comprehensive profile which is modeled by interacting with the AI and other entities of the metaverse. The AI is assisting the users in their own content creation, implementing business models through NFTs but also bringing together individuals or groups that align well with each other's preferences and profiles. The platform uses Zero-Knowldge technology and smart contracts to secure privacy and ownership of the various entities. And it will enable the creation of countless number of diverse applications, reaching that moment where apps are created on the fly by the AI.    

We want to adopt the ERC-6551 as we intend to integrate with multiple EVM-compatible chains and we need to work with nested NFTs. Given that for instance a conversation as asset itself holds multiple other assets such as: text messages, photos, sounds and so on. The same thinking applies to the user profile structure.     

The first and main application will have a chat-like interface displaying past conversations either with the AI or with another user. Users will connect to the platform through web3 authentication. And every in-chat interaction at the click may be turned into an NFT product with possible royalties. While the conversations are private and securely stored in the blockchain. Initially the platform will provide an AI assisting developers on crypto subjects and users with friendly creation of NFTs products.
